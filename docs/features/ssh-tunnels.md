# SSH Tunnel Management

## Architecture

```
TunnelManager
  └── TunnelSupervisor (per profile)
        ├── SSH child process (tokio::process::Command)
        ├── BackoffCalculator (reconnect timing)
        ├── ExitClassifier (stderr → ExitReason)
        └── AuditLog (SQLite WAL)
```

The **TunnelManager** orchestrates multiple **TunnelSupervisor** instances, one per active tunnel profile. Each supervisor owns an SSH child process and runs a supervision loop:

1. Validate the profile (fields, port ranges, duplicate bind ports)
2. Check local port availability for all `-L` forwards
3. Spawn `ssh` with constructed arguments (including agent forwarding if `SSH_AUTH_SOCK` is found)
4. Health check: if the process dies within 500ms, classify the exit immediately
5. If the process survives 500ms, mark as **Connected** and reset the backoff counter
6. On process exit, classify the exit reason from stderr patterns and exit code
7. If retryable, wait the backoff delay and loop; otherwise, stop

Tunnel starts claim a tokenized reservation before the first await. The
reservation is removed automatically if the start future fails or is cancelled,
but only when its token still owns the slot; a later start with the same profile
ID cannot be erased by an older cancelled future. Stop during startup removes
the reservation, prevents late supervisor publication, and suppresses the
`Started` audit record. `Started` is written only after the live handle is
published successfully.

### Shutdown

`TunnelSupervisor::stop()` sends a signal via a `oneshot` channel. The supervision loop catches this at any `tokio::select!` point and performs graceful shutdown:

- Unix: the ssh child is spawned into its own process group (`Command::process_group(0)`), and shutdown signals the whole group (`kill(-pid, ...)`), not just the direct child — SIGTERM first, wait up to 5 seconds, then SIGKILL to the group. A single-PID signal isn't enough: a real leak was found where the ssh/fake-ssh process forked a further child that a single-PID SIGTERM never reached. See `graceful_kill`'s doc comment in `supervisor.rs`.
- Windows: `taskkill /PID <id> /T /F` (tree-kill) followed by `child.kill()`.
- Every kill path is followed by an explicit `child.wait()` so the process is confirmed reaped, not just signaled — `stop_and_wait`/`stop_and_take_task` (below) depend on this to mean what they say.

`stop()`/`shutdown_all()` are fire-and-forget: they signal and return immediately, which is fine for a live, long-running app (the async cleanup finishes within a few seconds on the same runtime regardless of who's watching). Where the caller needs actual confirmation the process died — because it's about to disappear itself, or its own lifetime is too short to rely on "eventually" — use `stop_and_wait(id)` / `shutdown_all_and_wait()` instead, both bounded by `GRACEFUL_SHUTDOWN_TIMEOUT` (7s: the 5s SIGTERM grace period plus a scheduling/signal-delivery buffer) so neither can hang indefinitely.

## Profile Configuration

Profiles are TOML files with this structure:

```toml
id = "550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440000"
name = "prod-db-tunnel"
host = "bastion.example.com"
port = 2222
user = "deploy"
identity_file = "/home/deploy/.ssh/id_ed25519"
auto_connect = true

[[forwards]]
type = "Local"
bind_port = 5432
remote_host = "db.internal"
remote_port = 5432

[[forwards]]
type = "Remote"
bind_port = 9090
local_host = "127.0.0.1"
local_port = 9090

[options]
server_alive_interval = 15
server_alive_count_max = 3
strict_host_key_checking = "Yes"
```

### Storage Scopes

| Scope | Path | Precedence |
|-------|------|------------|
| Global | `<config_dir>/tunnels/*.toml` | Base |
| Per-repo | `<repo>/.tuic/tunnels/*.toml` | Overrides global (same ID) |

`ProfileStore::load_all()` merges both scopes, with per-repo profiles taking precedence.

## Tunnel States

```
Starting ──────► Connected
    │                 │
    │                 ▼
    │           Reconnecting ──► Connected (backoff reset)
    │                 │
    │                 ▼
    ▼           Stopped (max retries)
Error
    │
    ▼
Stopped
```

| State | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| Starting | SSH process is being spawned |
| Connected | SSH process survived health check; tunnel is operational |
| Reconnecting { attempt, reason } | Process exited with retryable reason; waiting backoff before retry |
| Stopped { reason } | Terminal state: user requested stop, max retries exceeded, or non-retryable exit |
| Error { message } | Validation failure or spawn error; no process was created |

## Exponential Backoff

`BackoffCalculator` computes retry delays:

- **Base**: 1000ms
- **Formula**: `min(base * 2^attempt, 30000)` + jitter
- **Jitter**: +/-25% of computed delay (uniform random)
- **Floor**: 100ms minimum delay
- **Max retries**: 10 (returns `None` after exhaustion)
- **Reset**: called on successful connection (attempt counter returns to 0)

Example sequence (base values, before jitter):
1s, 2s, 4s, 8s, 16s, 30s, 30s, 30s, 30s, 30s

## Exit Classification

`classify_exit()` inspects SSH stderr output first, then falls back to exit code:

| Pattern | ExitReason | Retryable |
|---------|-----------|-----------|
| "Permission denied" / "Authentication failed" | AuthFailed | No |
| "Host key verification failed" / "REMOTE HOST IDENTIFICATION HAS CHANGED" | HostKeyMismatch | No |
| "Address already in use" / "Could not request local forwarding" | PortInUse | No |
| "Connection refused" | ConnectionRefused | Yes |
| "Network is unreachable" / "No route to host" | NetworkDown | Yes |
| "Connection timed out" | Timeout | Yes |
| Exit code 130 (SIGINT) / 137 (SIGKILL) | UserKilled | No |

## Audit Logging

`AuditLog` uses SQLite with WAL journal mode for safe concurrent access.

### Schema

```sql
CREATE TABLE tunnel_events (
    id        INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
    timestamp TEXT    NOT NULL DEFAULT (strftime('%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%fZ', 'now')),
    tunnel_id TEXT    NOT NULL,
    kind      TEXT    NOT NULL,
    detail    TEXT    NOT NULL DEFAULT '{}'
);
```

Indexed on `tunnel_id` and `timestamp`.

### Event Kinds

`Started`, `Connected`, `Disconnected`, `Error`, `Retry`, `Stopped`

### Operations

- `insert(tunnel_id, kind, detail)` — Record an event
- `query_by_tunnel(tunnel_id, limit)` — Most recent N events for a tunnel
- `query_by_time_range(from, to)` — Events within a time window
- `rotate(max_age_days)` — Delete events older than N days

## UI Components

Create/edit lives in **Settings → Remote Servers** (story: SSH Tunnels + Remote Servers consolidation) — the standalone `TunnelsPanel` overlay is status/control-only now (Start/Stop/Log/Del + an "Edit in Settings" link); it no longer has its own "+ New Tunnel" entry point or per-row Edit button.

### TunnelProfileList

Extracted from `TunnelsPanel.tsx` so it renders identically in two places: the `TunnelsPanel` overlay (no `onEdit` — Settings owns editing) and the "SSH Tunnel" kind section of Settings → Remote Servers (`onEdit` opens the merged editor pre-filled). Lists all tunnel profiles with:
- Profile name and host
- TunnelStatusBadge showing current state
- Start/Stop toggle button
- Optional Edit button (Settings context only)
- Log (inline audit-event timeline) and Del

### RemoteConnectionEditor (the merged connection editor)

One form — Name + a Kind dropdown (SSH Tunnel / Remote Server — SSH / Remote Server — Direct / Remote Server — Local) — used for both tunnel profiles and remote-server connections. For Kind "SSH Tunnel":
- Name, then the shared `SshConnectionFields` component (host with `~/.ssh/config` autocomplete, port, user, identity file with Browse, live agent detection including each key's fingerprint, ServerAliveInterval, ServerAliveCountMax — now has its own field, previously fixed with no UI — and StrictHostKeyChecking)
- `PortForwardsEditor` (extracted from the old `TunnelEditorModal`): add/remove and type-aware endpoint fields — Local forwards save `remote_host`/`remote_port`, Remote forwards save `local_host`/`local_port`
- "Connect automatically on startup" checkbox
- A Test Connection button (one-shot SSH connectivity check, no forwards, before Save)
- Validation errors shown inline

`SshConnectionFields` and `PortForwardsEditor` are also used by `TunnelEditorModal.tsx`, which still exists and is still fully tested, but nothing in the live app opens it anymore — Settings owns tunnel editing end to end now.

### TunnelStatusBadge / ConnectionStatusBadge

`TunnelStatusBadge` is now a thin wrapper around a shared `ConnectionStatusBadge` presentation component (also used by the Remote Servers connection list, which has its own connecting/connected/error/disconnected vocabulary) — one status-dot-plus-label implementation instead of two independently-drifting copies. Color-coded status indicator:
- Green: Connected
- Blue (pulsing): Starting
- Orange: Reconnecting (shows attempt number)
- Red: Error
- Grey: Stopped

## Integration with Remote Servers

When creating a "Remote Server — SSH" connection (`RemoteConnection` with `RemoteTransport::Ssh`), a tunnel profile is automatically created to forward the daemon port. The tunnel supervisor manages the SSH connection, and the remote connection routes API calls through the forwarded port.

### Remote Daemon Provisioning

`RemoteTransport::Ssh` carries three additional fields beyond the shared `SshConnectionParams`/`remote_daemon_port`, all specific to the "Remote Server — SSH" kind (not shared with plain tunnel profiles): `start_if_not_running`, `leave_running_on_disconnect`, and `instance_id` (an optional `--instance <id>` argument used only when *this connection* launches or configures the remote daemon itself — never used for discovery, unlike Local's `instance_id`).

`ssh_provision.rs` owns the actual remote-side mechanics, all built as pure `build_*_command`/`parse_*_output` functions plus a thin async wrapper that runs the real SSH command — this split means the substantive logic (exact commands, output classification) is unit-testable without spawning any process:

- `probe_ssh_daemon_state` — `command -v tuic-remote` plus a port probe, classified as `Running` / `NotRunningBinaryPresent` / `NotRunningBinaryMissing`
- `probe_remote_artifact` + `install_tuic_remote_binary` — `uname -s`/`uname -m` to pick the right release artifact, downloaded and streamed to the remote over the same SSH connection's stdin (no `scp` dependency)
- `start_ssh_daemon` — fire-and-forget `nohup ... &disown`, passing `TUIC_PORT` and (if set) `--instance <id>`
- `stop_ssh_daemon` — PID-verified stop, mirroring `tunnels/port.rs`'s `kill_ssh_on_port` discipline (confirm the PID is actually the expected process before signaling), reimplemented as a single remote shell command since the process lives on the far end
- `set_ssh_daemon_password` — pipes credentials to `tuic-remote [--instance <id>] --set-password` over stdin, the same pipeable interface documented in [tuic-remote Setup](../user-guide/remote-access.md#setup-1)
- `compare_versions` — pure string comparison backing the version-mismatch warning shown after Connect (SSH and Direct both use this; Direct only ever compares, since none of the SSH-specific remote actions apply to it)

The frontend orchestration (`remoteConnections.ts`'s `ensureSshDaemonRunning`/`offerToConfigureIfUnconfigured`/`checkRemoteVersionAfterConnect`) gates every remote-state-changing step behind an explicit confirmation dialog (`PendingProvisionConfirmation`, rendered by `ProvisionConfirmDialog.tsx`) — never a silent default. A genuinely unconfigured daemon (empty username/password on the far end) is distinguished from one that's already configured by sending a deliberately-bogus Basic Auth header on the probe: `mcp_http/auth.rs`'s `validate_basic_auth` checks for an empty configured username/hash *before* even looking at the header, so the 401 body can only be `AuthResult::NotConfigured`'s ("Scan the QR code...") or `Invalid`'s ("Invalid credentials", proving a password already exists) — `MissingHeader` (identical body to `NotConfigured`) is structurally unreachable on this path. (Security review 2026-09-23 found that an *unauthenticated* probe couldn't actually make this distinction — every already-configured daemon was misclassified as unconfigured — fixed by always attaching the bogus header.) Only a confirmed `NotConfigured` response ever offers to auto-configure credentials.

## Auto-Connect

Profiles with `auto_connect: true` are started automatically on app launch. The tunnel store's `hydrate()` method loads all profiles, checks which are marked for auto-connect, and starts them if not already active. Hydration runs once and is guarded against duplicate calls.

The `auto_connect` field is persisted in the TOML profile:

```toml
auto_connect = true
```

## SSH Agent Detection

`detect_agent_type()` inspects `SSH_AUTH_SOCK` to identify the running SSH agent:

| Pattern in `SSH_AUTH_SOCK` | Detected Agent |
|---------------------------|----------------|
| `1password` or `2BUA8C4S2C` | 1Password |
| `secretive` | Secretive |
| `gpg` or `gnupg` | GPG Agent |
| (1Password socket exists but not active) | SSH Agent (1Password available) |
| (empty) | Not available |
| (other) | SSH Agent |

`list_ssh_agent_keys()` runs `ssh-add -l` to enumerate loaded keys, returning fingerprint, comment, and key type for each.

## Orphan SSH Process Cleanup

When `check_local_port()` reports `AddrInUse`, the supervisor calls `kill_ssh_on_port()` before retrying:

1. `lsof -ti tcp:<port> -sTCP:LISTEN` finds PIDs listening on the port
2. `ps -p <pid> -o comm=` verifies each PID is an `ssh` process
3. Only confirmed SSH processes receive `SIGTERM`

This handles stale SSH tunnels left over from a previous app crash without killing unrelated processes.

`check_local_port()` also distinguishes `PermissionDenied` (ports below 1024 on macOS/Linux require root) from `AddrInUse`, providing specific error messages for each case.

## Statusbar Shield

The status bar shows an SSH tunnel indicator:

- **Grey shield** — Tunnel profiles exist but none are currently connected
- **Green shield with count badge** — N tunnels are connected; the badge shows the count

Clicking the shield opens the Tunnels Panel.

## Shutdown on Exit

When the app exits (`RunEvent::Exit`), `TunnelManager::shutdown_all_and_wait()` — not the fire-and-forget `shutdown_all()` — iterates all active supervisors, signals every one to stop concurrently, and waits (bounded by the same `GRACEFUL_SHUTDOWN_TIMEOUT`, shared across the whole batch rather than paid per tunnel) for confirmation that each one's SSH process actually exited, before clearing the tunnel map. `RunEvent::Exit` blocks on this via `tauri::async_runtime::block_on`, the same way the dictation/streamdock shutdown steps in that same handler already block on their own cleanup. This is load-bearing, not defensive: the fire-and-forget `shutdown_all()` only sends a signal and returns, and since the process is about to exit, nothing would otherwise be left running long enough to actually confirm the SSH child processes are gone — ensuring no orphaned SSH child processes survive after the app closes
