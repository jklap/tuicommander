# Sidebar

The sidebar is your primary navigation for repositories, branches, and git operations.

## Toggle & Resize

- **Toggle visibility:** `Cmd+[`
- **Resize:** Drag the right edge (200–500px range)
- Width persists across sessions

## Repository Management

### Adding Repositories

Click the `+` button at the top of the sidebar and select a git repository folder.

### Repository Entry

Each repo shows a header with the repo name and action buttons:

- **Click** the header to expand/collapse the branch list
- **Click again** to toggle icon-only mode (shows repo initials — saves space)
- **`⋯` button** — Opens a menu with: Repo Settings, Create Worktree, Move to Group (with submenus for existing groups, Ungrouped, and New Group), Park Repository, Remove Repository
- **Right-click main worktree row** → **Switch Branch** submenu: shows all local branches with a checkmark on the current one. If the working tree is dirty, prompts to stash changes first. Blocks switching when a terminal has a running process.

### Removing Repositories

Repo `⋯` → Remove. This only removes the repo from the sidebar — it does not delete any files.

## Repository Groups

Organize repos into named, colored groups.

### Creating a Group

- Repo `⋯` → **Move to Group** → **New Group...**
- Enter a name in the dialog

### Moving Repos Between Groups

- **Drag** a repo onto a group header
- Or: Repo `⋯` → **Move to Group** → select a group
- To ungroup: Repo `⋯` → **Move to Group** → **Ungrouped**

### Managing Groups

Right-click a group header for:

- **Rename** — Change the group name
- **Change Color** — Pick a new accent color
- **Delete** — Remove the group (repos become ungrouped)

Groups can be collapsed/expanded by clicking the header, and reordered by drag-and-drop.

## Branches

### Selecting a Branch

Click a branch name to switch to it. This:

1. Creates a git worktree (for non-main branches) if one doesn't exist
2. Shows the branch's terminals (or creates a new one)
3. Hides terminals from the previous branch

### Branch Indicators

Each branch row can show:

| Indicator | Meaning |
|-----------|---------|
| **CI ring** | Proportional arc segments — green (passed), red (failed), yellow (pending) |
| **PR marker** | A colored square and the PR number. The color shows the highest-priority state; a conflict turns the square into a diamond. Hover or focus it for the state name, such as Draft, Conflicts, or CI Failed. Click for detail popover. |
| **Diff stats** | `+N / -N` additions and deletions, always shown beside the PR marker. Hover for exact counts and uncommitted files. |
| **Dirty badge** | The workspace contains staged, unstaged, or untracked changes. Hover or focus the badge for the removal-safety explanation. |
| **Merged badge** | Branches merged into main show a "Merged" badge |
| **Unmerged mark** | A small outlined square means the worktree has commits outside the default branch. A zero diff or dirty count does not mean those commits are merged. |
| **Unknown badge** | TUICommander could not verify the workspace state, so removal is blocked. Hover or focus the badge for the inspection error. |
| **Question icon** | An agent in this branch's terminal is asking a question |
| **Grey icon** | No active terminals in the repo — branch icons dim to grey |

### Branch Actions

- **Double-click** the branch name to rename the branch
- **Right-click** for context menu: Copy Path, Add Terminal, Create Worktree (for branches without a worktree), Delete Worktree, Open in IDE, Rename Branch/Worktree, Merge & Archive

### Agent and session activity

Nested agent and terminal rows are an opt-in feature and are disabled by default. Enable **Settings → Appearance → Tabs → Nested Terminal Tabs** to show them; the change applies immediately.

When enabled, each branch with open terminal sessions has a separate, always-visible chevron to show or hide agents. The status icon and row select the branch. Enter or Space activates the focused chevron. The collapsed session count stays beside it. Agents are shown by default, and collapsed state is remembered. Expanded, the list shows a single activity card containing the sessions assigned to that branch:

- Detected agents show their icon, terminal name, current intent or task, last-update age, and status.
- A sub-agent row has a muted robot tag; hover or focus it to see the parent agent. The GitHub badge in the repo header keeps its accent color.
- Plain shells appear as terminal rows.
- Clicking a row switches to that session.
- A branch with one session can still expand.

When the setting is off, the sidebar intentionally shows none of the activity card or nested rows. Enabling it does not create a session or detect an agent outside an open terminal assigned to the branch.

## Remote-Only PRs

When a repository has open PRs on branches that only exist on the remote (not checked out locally), a badge appears in the branch section. Click it to open a popover listing these PRs. Each row shows the PR number, title, and state badge. Click a row to expand an inline accordion showing PR details, with action buttons:

- **Checkout** — Create a local tracking branch
- **Create Worktree** — Create a worktree for the branch
- **Merge** — Merge the PR via GitHub API (shown when PR is mergeable)
- **View Diff** — Open PR diff in a panel tab
- **Approve** — Submit an approving review

### Dismiss & Show Dismissed

Remote-only PRs can be dismissed to reduce sidebar clutter. Right-click the remote PRs badge or use the "Dismiss" action in the accordion. A "Show Dismissed" toggle at the bottom reveals dismissed PRs again.

## Park Repos

Temporarily hide repos you're not actively using.

### Parking

Right-click any repo in the sidebar → **Park**. The repo disappears from the main list.

### Viewing Parked Repos

A button in the sidebar footer shows all parked repos with a count badge. Click it to open a popover listing them.

### Unparking

Click **Unpark** on any repo in the parked repos popover. It returns to the main sidebar list.

## Compact and rich layout

The **layout button** in the toolbar (left of the filter icon) cycles the sidebar through three modes and prints the current one on itself: **A** (auto, outlined), **C** (compact), **R** (rich). The choice is saved.

**Compact** is the one-line rows. **Rich** keeps the same navigation density and adds facts:

- **Branch:** the PR state word and title; last-commit age; ahead/behind of the upstream (`↑2 ↓1`); diff stats; `N dirty` (click opens Changes); `Merged`, `Stale` (no commit for 30 days, not merged), `Unknown` (removal blocked, status could not be read) and `unmerged`. Each chip explains itself in a tooltip, with the same removal-safety text compact shows. A main checkout never shows stale, merged, dirty or unknown.
- **Agent:** its state (Working, Idle, Needs input, Error) and what it is doing; its in-session subagents, one line each with state, title, tool calls and age (more than three fold into "N subagents", click to expand); TUIC child sessions nest under their parent agent.
- **Repository:** current branch, positive open-PR and worktree counts, and the age of the last remote poll.

Compact carries the same facts in tooltips: the branch name's tooltip has the commit age, ahead/behind and the stale rule; an agent row's tooltip has its state and line. Subagents and nesting exist only in rich.

**Auto** shows rich when the list fits the window or the primary pointer is a finger, compact otherwise. It uses a conservative 52 px row budget for expanded working-agent details, minus 96 px of toolbar and footer. Rich branch names and stats stay on one line; long names truncate and full PR titles remain in tooltips. Touch branch actions remain in the existing swipe tray.

Subagent lines come from the existing `progress_flow` command, read at most every 5 seconds per repository, only in rich.

## Active-Only Filter

When you have many repos open, hide the ones you aren't using right now.

Click the **filter icon** in the toolbar (next to the sidebar collapse button) to show only repositories that have at least one open terminal. The icon turns accent-colored while the filter is on, and a banner at the top of the sidebar shows how many repos are shown out of the total — click it (or "Show all") to clear the filter. The filter is session-only and resets when you restart.

## Quick Branch Switcher

Switch branches by number without the mouse:

1. **Hold** `Cmd+Ctrl` (macOS) or `Ctrl+Alt` (Windows/Linux)
2. All branches show **numbered badges** (1, 2, 3...)
3. **Press a number** (`1–9`) to switch to that branch instantly
4. **Release** the modifier to dismiss the overlay

## Git Quick Actions

When a repo is active, the bottom of the sidebar shows quick action buttons:

- **Pull** — `git pull` in the active terminal
- **Push** — `git push`
- **Fetch** — `git fetch`
- **Stash** — `git stash`

For more git operations (staging, commit, push, pull, stash, blame, history), use the Git Panel (`Cmd+Shift+D`).


### Touch Branch Actions

Swipe a branch row left to reveal **More**, **+**, and, for removable linked
worktrees, a red remove button. **More** opens the branch menu. Tap **+** to
add a terminal, or hold it to choose an agent. Removal uses the existing
confirmation dialog and is disabled while removal is in progress.

Swipe right, tap the row, or tap elsewhere to close the actions. Opening another
row closes the previous one. Vertical swipes continue to scroll the sidebar.
Mouse and trackpad controls keep their existing hover behavior.

In rich mode, sessions idle for more than two hours fold into an expandable count. Backend activity timestamps determine age; busy sessions, awaiting input, unread output, selected rows and parents of visible children stay visible. Expanding preserves row order. Compact mode does not fold idle sessions.

Rich working agent rows reserve two clamped intent lines. Idle, awaiting-input and error rows stay on one line with status dots; their full intent, task or prompt remains in the tooltip. Compact rows keep their one-line layout.

Rich navigation keeps compact typography and padding. Branch identity and facts share one line, with names truncated and full PR/lifecycle facts in tooltips. Repository metadata disappears when PR and worktree counts are both zero. Header controls use compact sizing to protect repo names. Returned subagents fold into an expandable count independently of running work.
