# Private secret forms

An agent can request named username, password, OTP or SSO-link fields with the
`secret` MCP tool. TUICommander opens a separate native window containing only
those fields. The tool receives names and `stored` or `declined`, never values.
SSO links are displayed as text; they do not navigate automatically.

`request` waits for entry or decline; the form expires after five minutes.
The CLI and MCP bridge keep this request open for 305 seconds. `run` allows
another 120 seconds for the approved child (425 seconds in the transports).
Update both companions when installing this fix. Restart the rebuilt desktop
manually; Rust does not hot-reload.

If no window appears, inspect logs with source `secrets`: `Secret tool dispatched`,
`Opening private secret form`, `Creating private secret window`, then
`Private secret window created` or `Private secret window creation failed`.
These stages do not include field values or the private entry capability.

The form states: **the agent cannot read this value, but a command you approve
can send it anywhere**. Approve only commands you trust. This boundary protects
TUICommander tool results and its entry UI; it is not an OS sandbox against an
agent running as the same user, or protection against arbitrary transformations
or exfiltration by the approved executable.

Values exist only in backend memory. Removal and normal application exit
zeroize them. Restart clears values and templates; `run` reports `missing`.
There is no Keychain entry or configuration file for this feature.

## Run and consent

`secret action=run names=["GITHUB_TOKEN"] argv=["gh","api","user"] cwd="/absolute/project"`
executes the resolved executable directly, with no shell. Requested values are
injected only into that child's environment. The child inherits only core
path, home, locale and temporary-directory variables. It has no terminal input,
and stdout/stderr are captured in pipes rather than a PTY or a tcap stream.

Commands outside the in-memory allowlist show the exact resolved argv, directory
and secret names for consent. You can retain that exact argv until exit.
Consent also binds the names and canonical working directory. Changing any
argument, name or directory requires fresh consent; placeholders are not used.

Shell/interpreter evaluation (`-c`, `-e` and equivalents), `env` and `printenv`
are denied when they are the executable, even with approval. Wrappers such as
`nohup env` are an accepted limitation; approve only trusted executables. Evaluation-like options are rejected regardless
of the executable name, so renaming an interpreter does not bypass the policy. Captured output masks exact values, standard and
URL-safe base64 (also inside Basic-auth payloads), JSON-escaped values,
lower/upper hex and URL/form encodings, including line breaks
inside an echo. Output over 1 MiB per stream or a 120-second timeout is withheld.
No raw output is logged, journalled, or added to a terminal ring.

## HTTP and phone entry

The private window shows a one-time entry path. Open it on your trusted
TUICommander server address. The path carries a nonce in its fragment; the form
removes it from history immediately. A nonce is bound to one open form and is
consumed only by a valid submit. Replay and guessed nonces are rejected.
Responses are not cached or frameable.

Browser and phone entry use the existing application router, authentication and
transport. Use HTTPS to protect values in transit. This feature does not enforce
TLS or loopback-only HTTP, and does not isolate entry from application-origin
service workers. A desktop host must open the request; headless daemons cannot
initiate this form yet.

While the private native window is open, TUIC blocks new `ui`, `debug`, and
upstream MCP inspection calls, including proxied screenshots. Already-running
inspection calls are not cancelled and their results are not withheld.
Bootstrap checks the native window identity; the main WebView cannot acquire
its nonce. Inputs are cleared and unmounted before submit begins, and the native
window is destroyed after successful entry. OS-level screen capture outside
TUIC is not controlled by this mechanism.
