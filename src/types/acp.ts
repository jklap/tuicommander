/**
 * The ACP wire, as TUICommander's Rust client actually writes it.
 *
 * These are not the ACP protocol's own types. They are the shapes
 * `src-tauri/src/acp/mod.rs` serializes, which is a deliberately narrower
 * surface: the client refuses stdio MCP servers and any elicitation mode but
 * `form` before they reach a host, so a type here that admitted them would
 * describe a frame that cannot arrive.
 *
 * A boolean config option is **not** one of those, and the difference matters
 * because the two failures are opposite. `client_boolean_config: false` is a
 * capability this client does not advertise, and `AcpCapabilitySnapshot`
 * excludes it for that reason — but Rust passes `Vec<SessionConfigOption>`
 * through unfiltered, so an agent that publishes a boolean option anyway
 * produces a frame that arrives and is simply never rendered. Deleting the
 * `{ type: "boolean" }` member here to match the capability would break
 * parsing of a frame that can and does turn up (#810-4986).
 *
 * Every field name below is pinned by `src-tauri/tests/story785_event_wire_shapes.rs`.
 * That test exists because both defects it caught were silent: serde renames
 * variants and fields under separate attributes, and an internally tagged enum
 * wrapping a bare value invents a key from the value rather than failing. Neither
 * threw. Both would have produced a store that parsed nothing and reported no
 * error, so do not widen a type here to make a frame fit — check the test first.
