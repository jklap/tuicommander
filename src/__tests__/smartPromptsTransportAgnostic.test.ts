/**
 * Story 706-8d98 investigated a claim that Smart Prompts "blocks in browser
 * mode without saying so" and needed an isTauri()-gated "requires the desktop
 * app" message. That premise did not hold: every execution mode (inject,
 * shell, headless, api) already goes through `invoke()` calls that are
 * HTTP-mapped for IPC/HTTP parity, and `providerRegistryStore.hydrate()` runs
 * unconditionally at bootstrap — nothing here is actually desktop-only. The
 * story's criterion 2 was rejected rather than implemented (see the story's
 * worklog): adding an isTauri() branch would regress a feature that works in
 * browser mode today.
 *
 * A source scan rather than a behavioral test, because what must never exist
 * is the reference itself — the moment `isTauri` shows up in these files it
 * means someone is about to fake-disable a working feature, and that decision
 * needs re-litigating with evidence, not a passing branch that silently
 * degrades browser clients.
