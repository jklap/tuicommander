/**
 * The microphone and the speaker of a browser tab, on a WebSocket.
 *
 * Transport only, deliberately. Utterance boundaries, the activation phrase,
 * the hold-back and whether a turn may be delivered are all decided in Rust,
 * exactly as they are for the desktop endpoint — this file captures samples,
 * ships them, and plays back what comes the other way. Anything here that
 * started deciding *when* someone had finished speaking would be a second
 * implementation of the segmenter, disagreeing with the first one only on
 * browsers.
 *
 * ## Wire format
 *
 * | Direction | Frame | Meaning |
 * |---|---|---|
 * | up | binary | `f32` little-endian samples, mono, 16 kHz |
 * | up | `{"type":"playback-ended"}` | the reply finished playing |
 * | down | binary | `u32` little-endian sample rate, then `f32` samples |
 * | down | `{"type":"stop"}` | stop playing and drop the queue |
 * | down | `{"type":"pause"}` | hold the reply where it is, and any that arrives |
 * | down | `{"type":"resume"}` | carry on from where it was held |
 *
 * Resampling happens here rather than on the server: the `AudioContext` is
 * created at 16 kHz and resamples the device's native rate for free, and
 * sending 48 kHz would triple the bytes for audio the segmenter throws away.
