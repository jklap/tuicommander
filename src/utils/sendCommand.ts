 *  2. \r (Enter — sent separately)
 *
 *  The Ctrl-U prefix is required for Ink-based agents (Claude Code, Codex, etc.)
 *  which ignore Ctrl-U when bundled with text in raw mode, and is desirable for
 *  POSIX shells with readline (bash/zsh/fish) where it cancels any pending input.
 *
 *  On native Windows shells (cmd.exe, PowerShell) without a detected agent,
 *  Ctrl-U is not a line-kill control code and is echoed literally (e.g. "§cmd"
 *  or "^Ucmd"), breaking the command. We skip the prefix in that case.
 *
 *  Critical: git-bash on Windows runs bash/readline — same needs as a POSIX
 *  shell on Linux. The `shellFamily` argument resolves the ambiguity; when
 *  omitted we fall back to `isWindows()` (safe for cmd/PowerShell, wrong for
 *  git-bash — callers should provide shellFamily whenever possible).
 *
 *  @param writeFn      Function that writes raw data to the PTY.
 *  @param text         Command text to inject (without trailing newline).
 *  @param agentType    Detected agent in the PTY (null = plain shell).
 *  @param shellFamily  Classification of the session's underlying shell.
 *  @param submit       When false, the text is typed but the trailing Enter is
 *                      withheld so the user reviews and executes it manually.
 *                      Used by reviewable Smart Prompts and by suggestion chips
 *                      carrying shell metacharacters (spoofable via OSC 7770
