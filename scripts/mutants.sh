#   scripts/mutants.sh [RANGE]      default RANGE=HEAD~1 (that commit vs HEAD)
#
# Tests the committed tree at HEAD: commit first. Only mutants overlapping the
# diff run (`--in-diff`); a full-tree run is N mutants x one incremental build
# of the lib crate and is deliberately not offered.
#
# Runs `--in-place` in a disposable `git archive` export under .tmp/ instead of
# the copy cargo-mutants makes by default: `tauri::generate_context!` needs
# `../dist` next to src-tauri, which a copy of the workspace root does not have,
# and the copy would land in $TMPDIR where every freshly built test binary is
# scanned on exec. `--in-place` implies one job, which is also the budget.
#
# An export, not a worktree: a detached worktree is an "orphan" to a running
# TUICommander, and its orphan cleanup removes it on the next repo refresh —
# mid-run, with the mutant applied.
