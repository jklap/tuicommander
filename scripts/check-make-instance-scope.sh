# Guard: `make dev` must launch on the shared production config directory, and
# only `make test` may default to the isolated `tuic-test` instance.
#
# Written as a bare `TUIC_APP_INSTANCE?=tuic-test`, that default is a *global*
# make variable — its position in the file buys nothing — so `make dev` expanded
# it too and started Boss's daily driver against an empty
# `instances/tuic-test/`: every repository appeared to have vanished. The fix is
# a target-specific assignment, which no reader can tell from the broken form by
# looking at it. Hence this check, which asks make what it actually expands.
#
# It regressed once with the fix already written (2026-09-14, archived unapplied
# under .claude/yagni/) and cost a second scare on 2026-09-17.
