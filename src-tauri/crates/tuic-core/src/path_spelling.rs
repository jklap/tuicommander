//! How a host path is spelled: absolute on any platform, and the portable

///
/// `Path::is_absolute` answers for the host only, and the validators that call
/// this decide whether a path may escape a boundary. Judging a foreign shape
/// as relative is the dangerous half of that: on Windows `Path::join` replaces
/// the root when the joined path has one, so a repo path joined with
/// `/etc/passwd` lands at the root of the repo's drive rather than inside the
/// repo. So each shape the other platform uses gets an explicit string check —
/// `C:\…` and `\\…` do not parse as absolute on unix, and a leading `/` does
/// not parse as absolute on Windows, where a path without a drive letter is
/// merely rooted.

/// Two consumers need it and they need the same answer. `git` is one — the gix

/// Windows `fs::canonicalize` does not oblige: it returns a verbatim `\\?\`
/// path with `\`, while `git worktree list` prints `C:/Users/…`, so a consumer
/// comparing the two finds no match at all. A git *config value* is the other:
/// there `\` starts an escape sequence, so a Windows path written verbatim
/// reaches git mangled. `/` is also the separator the rest of TUIC carries in a
/// path string (see `fs::DirEntry::path` in the app crate).
///
/// Only Windows paths are rewritten: `\` is a legal character in a unix file
