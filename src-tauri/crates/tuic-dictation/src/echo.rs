//! Hearing the user over our own voice.
//!
//! The microphone hears the speaker. Without this, the energy VAD in
//! [`continuous`](super::continuous) opens a turn on the reply the application
//! is speaking, transcribes it, and answers itself. Muting capture while
//! speaking would stop that and would also stop the user interrupting, which
//! is the one thing hands-free has to get right — so the capture stream stays
//! open and the echo is subtracted from it instead.
//!
//! ## The two streams must arrive in step
//!
//! A canceller subtracts a delayed, filtered copy of the **far end** (what we
//! played) from the **near end** (what the microphone heard). It can only do
//! that if it is fed both at the same pace: one 10 ms frame of each, in turn.
//!
//! Our two sources do not behave that way. Capture arrives in small chunks as
//! the device produces them, while [`speaker`](super::speaker) hands over a
//! whole rendered utterance at once — seconds of audio in one call, before a
//! single sample of it has left the speaker. Pushing that straight into a
//! canceller would put it seconds ahead of the microphone and it would subtract
//! nothing.
//!
//! [`FarEnd`] is the buffer that fixes the pace: the reply goes in whole, and
//! comes out only as fast as capture is consumed, padded with silence whenever
//! nothing is playing. Alignment is therefore by sample count rather than by
//! wall clock, and the residual offset — the device's own output latency — is
//! what the canceller's delay estimator is for.
//!
//! ## Everything here runs at 16 kHz
//!
//! Not a preference: [`audio`](super::audio) already converts capture to mono
//! 16 kHz for Whisper, and 16 kHz is one of the rates the WebRTC APM accepts,
//! so the near end needs no conversion at all. The far end is whatever the
//! speech engine rendered — 24 kHz for Pocket TTS, anything for a
//! user-supplied command — and is converted on the way in.

// Same reason as `speech.rs` and `speaker.rs`: the port and its adapter are
// finished and tested, and the consumer that arms them is the hands-free
// runtime in `continuous.rs`. Drop this when that wiring lands.
