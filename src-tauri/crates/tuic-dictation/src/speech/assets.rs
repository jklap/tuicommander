//! What a speech installation is made of, and how it gets onto the disk.
//!
//! Nothing here is fetched from a name. Every byte this module downloads is
//! named by a URL pinned to an immutable revision and checked against a sha256
//! written in this file, so an upstream that is compromised — or merely
//! re-tagged — produces a refused install rather than a different model. That
//! is the whole reason the catalogue is Rust and not a JSON file beside the
//! binary: a manifest the installer could rewrite is not an allowlist.
//!
//! ```text
//! <config dir>/models/speech/
//!   .staging/<asset id>/          while installing; the engine never looks here
//!   onnxruntime/libonnxruntime.dylib
//!   italian/
//!     bundle.json  tokenizer.model  *.onnx
//!     voices/giovanni.safetensors  the voice the language ships with
//!   voices/italian/jean.safetensors  a voice downloaded on its own
//! ```
//!
//! A downloaded voice lives outside its language directory on purpose:
//! [`promote`] replaces a language directory whole, and a voice kept inside it
//! would be deleted by every update of the language.
//!
//! # Two upstreams
//!
//! The ONNX graphs come from `KevinAHM/pocket-tts-onnx` on Hugging Face. The
//! voices come from Kyutai's `kyutai/pocket-tts-without-voice-cloning`. Both are
//! public and serve a sha256 for every file.
//!
//! Not `kyutai/pocket-tts`: that repository is **gated** because it ships the
//! weights that clone a voice from a sample, and reaching it needs an accepted
//! use policy and a token, which an app cannot supply for the user. The
//! ungated repository leaves the cloning weights out and carries the same
//! speaker embeddings byte for byte — only the preset voices are used here. The
//! attribution for both is in `THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES.md`.
//!
//! # Why installing is two steps
//!
//! The app's download adapter verifies into `.staging`, holding no lock; [`promote`]
//! renames the staged directory into place. Splitting them is what lets a
//! 125 MB download run while the engine is still speaking, and confines the
//! part that must exclude synthesis to a rename. The caller owns that lock —
//! see [`super::library::SpeechLibrary`].
