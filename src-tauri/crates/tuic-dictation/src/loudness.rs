//! The loudness stage: every spoken reply at one level, whatever the voice.
//!
//! Voices differ by more than 10 dB in their rendered level, and one reply
//! drifts within itself. This stage runs offline on the whole buffer before it
//! is played, in three steps:
//!
//! 1. **Levelling.** A 300 ms running RMS envelope drives a gain toward the
//!    reply's own speech level, with a ratio from `levelling` (0 = off, 1 = 4:1)
//!    and at most +12 dB of boost. Samples whose envelope is below the -50 dBFS
//!    gate are silence and are not levelled.
//! 2. **Gain** to `volume_db`, measured over speech only. Gated samples are
//!    never boosted, so the noise floor between sentences stays where it was.
//! 3. **A look-ahead limiter** at -1 dBFS, for peaks the gain pushed past it.
//!    Offline, every peak is known before it arrives, so the gain ramps down
//!    ahead of it and never exceeds what that peak needs: nothing reaches the
//!    final clamp except float rounding.
//!
//! Not rodio's `Limit`, which the plan first named: it is a streaming limiter
//! that takes a logarithm and a power of every sample, and measured 5.3 ms of
//! a 10.6 ms budget-breaking run on 30 s of audio. This stage runs between
//! synthesis and playback, so its time is heard as delay.
