//! An AI review of one pull request, run by ego.
//!
//! What came back from story 784 and what deliberately did not.
//!
//! **Back:** the findings, the confidence gate, and the posting flow. A finding
//! is still `{path, line, severity, message, confidence}`, still filtered by
//! [`finding_confidence_threshold`] before anything renders, and still posted
//! through `github::post_pr_review` by the popover. Those three are what
//! criterion 1 of story 795-320b names, and they are the contract.
//!
//! **Not back:** the multi-turn engine. The deleted version held a session per
//! repo for 300 seconds, spent one LLM turn on an overview and one per file, and
//! let the model call `read_file` between them. That was the embedded agent, and
//! it is the thing 784 deleted. This is one unattended ego turn over the whole
//! diff (`acp::oneshot`), which is why there is no session cache, no per-file
//! phase and no tool dispatch here.
//!
//! **Also not back:** `llm_used` and `llm_model`. Which model ran is ego's
//! configuration, not a property of this call, and TUICommander is not told. A
//! field that could only ever be reported as `null` is worse than no field.
//!
//! The diff goes in whole rather than being fetched by the model: the turn has
//! no host tools, so what ego sees is what this module sends, which is the same
//! reason `improvement_scan` assembles its own snapshot.
