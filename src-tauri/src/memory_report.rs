//! Where the process's memory actually is.
//!
//! On 2026-09-08 the backend reached a **40.7 GB** physical footprint after 13
//! hours (`JetsamEvent-2026-09-08-214808` names it as the machine's largest
//! process; `vmmap` reports 1,453,700 live allocations in the default malloc
//! zone at 1% fragmentation, and `leaks` finds only 47 MB of it unreferenced).
//! So it is not fragmentation and not a classic leak: some structure the app
//! still holds a reference to grew and was never pruned.
//!
//! Nothing could say which one. Every candidate had to be excluded by reading
//! code and by re-running the workload on a second instance, and a 40 GB process
//! that macOS marks as not-debuggable cannot be asked what it is holding — the
//! evidence dies with the incident.
//!
//! This report is the answer to that. One request names the structure: entry
//! counts for every map that grows with sessions or clients, and measured bytes
//! for the four that hold the payloads. It is deliberately on-demand and not on
//! the diagnostics tick — walking a session's log lines is cheap once and is not
//! something to do every five seconds forever.
