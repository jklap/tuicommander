//! File pickers that cannot take the process down with them.
//!
//! On 2026-09-18 the app died mid-session with:
//!
//! ```text
//! NSXPCSharedListener ... listener 'com.apple.view-bridge': Connection interrupted
//! thread 'main' panicked at objc2-app-kit-0.3.2/src/generated/NSOpenPanel.rs:127:5:
//! unexpected NULL returned from +[NSOpenPanel openPanel]
//! ```
//!
//! AppKit's link to the window server had been interrupted — the same degraded
//! post-standby state that `webview_recovery.rs` already recovers the WebView
//! from. In that state `+[NSOpenPanel openPanel]` answers NULL, and the
//! `objc2-app-kit` binding turns NULL into a panic. It happens on the **main**
//! thread, so the unwind runs out through AppKit's own frames and the process is
//! gone, taking every live PTY session with it.
//!
//! **Wrapping `tauri_plugin_dialog`'s picker in `catch_unwind` does not help, and
//! that is the whole reason this module exists.** The plugin builds the panel
//! inside *its own* `run_on_main_thread` closure (`desktop.rs:176-181` in
//! 2.7.2), while the calling command body runs on a tokio worker — a different
//! thread, so the guard never sees the panic. The only frame that can catch it is
//! one we own on the main thread, which is what `pick` below is.
//!
//! This is the shape `native_drag.rs` already uses for the same reason: a
//! third-party native call, dispatched to the main thread by us, with the unwind
//! stopped before it reaches objc.
//!
//! Upstream offers no fix to take instead: `objc2-app-kit` 0.3.2 is the latest
//! published version, and the only `tauri-plugin-dialog` newer than 2.7.2 is the
//! 3.0.0-alpha prerelease.
