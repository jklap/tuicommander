//! A connected remote machine's sessions, mirrored onto this one.
//!
//! The desktop renders idle / busy / question badges from two things: the rows
//! `list_active_sessions` returns, and the `session-state-changed` push that
//! moves them between polls. A remote daemon runs its own accumulator and
//! publishes exactly the same pair on its own `/events` — so parity needs no
//! second state machine here, only a pipe.
//!
//! That is what this module is. Per connected connection one task:
//!
//! * seeds from the daemon's `GET /sessions`, so a tab that was already running
//!   when we connected has a badge before anything moves;
//! * consumes the daemon's `/events` with **no** `types=` filter and repeats
//!   every frame on the local bus, with the same dual-emit a local producer
//!   uses. An unfiltered stream is the point: a future event type crosses with
//!   no change here.
//!
//! A mirrored row carries `connection_id`, which is the only field that tells
//! it apart from a local one. Everything downstream — the badge, the
//! notification, the queue gate — is the local code path, unchanged.
//!
//! The daemon's session ids are UUIDs minted on the daemon, so they cannot
//! collide with this machine's.
