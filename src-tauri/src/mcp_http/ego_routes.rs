//! The HTTP half of the ego command-line surface, one route per `ego_*` command.
//!
//! Every handler calls the same `ego_cli` core the Tauri command calls, so the
//! desktop and a browser cannot get different answers about which model is the
//! default or which provider has a credential.
//!
//! Both routes take the spawn guard, and this is the one place the ego surface
//! differs from `/acp/*` on purpose. There, only `connect` and `reconnect` are
//! guarded, because only they start a process and every other route needs a
//! connection id one of those two handed out. Here **every** route starts a
//! process, and `config set` writes a person's ego configuration — so an
//! unauthenticated remote caller gets neither the read nor the write.
