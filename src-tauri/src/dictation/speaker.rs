//! The reply side of a voice conversation: a bounded queue that renders text
//! and gets it out of the speaker, and that stops on a word.
//!
//! [`continuous`](super::continuous) is the listening half and owns the
//! generation counter that says which turn is current. This is the speaking
//! half and carries the same number, for one reason: **a reply must be able to
//! arrive too late.** Synthesis takes real time, so a reply can still be
//! rendering when the user starts talking again. Playing it then is not a
//! small glitch — it is the application talking over the person it is
//! listening to, and every stage here is arranged so that cannot happen.
//!
//! ```text
//!   say(generation, text)
//!        │
//!        ▼
//!   [queue]  bounded; a reply whose generation is over is dropped, not rendered
//!        │
//!        ▼
//!   synthesis   cancellable; the in-flight request holds a SpeechCancel
//!        │
//!        ▼
//!   generation checked again   <-- audio rendered for a turn that ended is
//!        │                         discarded here rather than played
//!        ▼
//!   output.play()
//! ```
//!
//! Three separate checks rather than one, because the reply can become stale
//! at three different moments and only the last of them has audio to throw
//! away.
//!
//! ## What this module does not do
//!
//! It does not decide *when* to interrupt. Hearing the user over the speaker
//! is acoustic echo cancellation, which is story 816-cbbf's other half and is
//! not in this file: whoever detects near-end speech calls [`Speaker::hush`]
//! and this stops. That split is deliberate — the queue's correctness can be
//! proven without a microphone, and a microphone test cannot prove the queue.
