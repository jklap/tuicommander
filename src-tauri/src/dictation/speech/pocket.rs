//! Pocket TTS behind the speech port, run in-process over ONNX Runtime.
//!
//! **Nothing of the model lives in this repository.** A bundle is a directory
//! of ONNX graphs, a SentencePiece tokenizer and a `bundle.json` manifest,
//! downloaded at runtime under the dictation models directory; the voices are
//! separate safetensors files beside it. The weights are Kyutai's, released
//! under CC-BY-4.0 — see `THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES.md`. Everything here is the
//! runtime that reads them.
//!
//! ```text
//! <config dir>/models/speech/
//!   onnxruntime/libonnxruntime.dylib     the runtime library, also downloaded
//!   italian/
//!     bundle.json  tokenizer.model  *.onnx
//!     voices/giovanni.safetensors
//! ```
//!
//! Why in-process rather than a subprocess or a C library: the four candidate
//! runtimes were measured against Italian, and only an ONNX export covers it —
//! the Candle crate and sherpa-onnx both carry English-only assets today. The
//! Python package works but would put an interpreter in the shipping path.
//! Decision recorded on story 823-c260.
//!
//! `ort` is used in `load-dynamic` mode on purpose. Its default feature
//! downloads onnxruntime during the build and then has to be bundled into the
//! app on three platforms; here the library is fetched with the model it
//! serves, and its absence is a [`SpeechError::ModelUnavailable`] a user can
//! act on rather than a build that needs the network.
