//! The languages dictation offers, and their names.
//!
//! Whisper reports a two-letter code and nothing else. A model told to "reply
//! in it" would have to guess; told to "reply in Italian" it cannot. So one
//! table turns the code into the English name, and everything that has to name
//! a language to a person or to a model reads it here.
//!
//! The list mirrors `WHISPER_LANGUAGES` in `src/stores/dictation.ts`, which is
//! what the Dictation panel offers. Two copies, because the panel is TypeScript
//! and the instruction is built in Rust; [`the drift test`](tests) reads the
//! TypeScript and fails if they stop agreeing.

/// Every dictation language, code first, English name second.
///
/// `auto` is deliberately absent: it is a *setting*, not a language, and
/// nothing downstream may ever be told to reply in "Auto-detect".
