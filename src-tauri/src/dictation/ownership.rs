//! One TUICommander instance per config directory owns dictation.
//!
//! Two desktop instances on one config directory (a debug or worktree build next
//! to the installed app) would both register the global hotkey and both open the
//! microphone. The owner is decided by an exclusive advisory lock on a file in
//! the config directory: the OS releases it when the process dies, so a crash
//! never leaves a stale owner behind, which a PID file would.
//!
//! A named instance (`TUIC_APP_INSTANCE`) has its own config directory and so
//! its own lock.
//!
//! The lock guards OS-global input, not only dictation: the window-toggle
//! hotkey, the Fn key monitor and the microphone. A second instance registering
//! the same hotkey combo is one candidate cause of the 2026-09-30 incident.
//!
//! Ownership is decided once, at startup. A non-owner stays one after the owner
//! quits and must be restarted to take dictation over.
