//! Hands-free for a client that is not this machine.
//!
//! The desktop endpoint opens a `cpal` device and a `rodio` sink. A browser has
//! neither: its microphone and its speaker are on the other side of a
//! WebSocket, several hundred milliseconds away and able to vanish without
//! notice. What does *not* change is where the decisions are made — utterance
//! boundaries, the activation phrase, the hold-back and whether a turn may be
//! delivered all stay in [`continuous`](super::continuous). This module is the
//! transport underneath them and nothing else.
//!
//! ```text
//!   browser mic ──ws──▶ [BrowserLink.capture] ──▶ VoiceEndpoint::drain
//!   browser out ◀──ws── [BrowserLink.playback] ◀── speaker::Output::play
//! ```
//!
//! One [`BrowserLink`] per connected client, keyed by the owner id the client
//! names when it opens the socket. That id is the same string
//! [`arm_hands_free`](super::commands::arm_hands_free) binds, which is what
//! keeps the two halves from being wired to different clients: arming with an
//! owner nobody has connected is refused rather than served by this machine's
//! microphone.
//!
//! ## Why a link outlives its socket
//!
//! The socket closing is the *event* that ends a conversation, but it is not
//! the thing the runtime polls — it polls [`VoiceEndpoint::connected`] once a
//! tick. So the reader task marks the link dead and leaves it; the runtime sees
//! it on the next tick and disarms with `OwnerDisconnected`, which is the same
//! path a dead desktop microphone takes, cancelling the pending transcript and
//! the queued voice entries with it.
