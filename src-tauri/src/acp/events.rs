//! The ordered record of what happened on one connection.
//!
//! A host that renders a turn needs two things a snapshot cannot give it: the
//! order the agent said things in, and the ability to join late without losing
//! what it missed. So every accepted callback and local settlement is stamped
//! with a sequence number here, appended, and only then fanned out.
//!
//! The journal is bounded, which means a subscriber can fall far enough behind
//! that what it asked for is gone. That is answered with [`stream_gap`] rather
//! than by resuming past the hole: the missing chunks exist nowhere in this
//! client, and a stream that quietly skipped them would render as a turn where
//! part of what the model said simply never happened. Recovery is a fresh
//! connection and `session/load`, which replays from ego, the only place that
//! actually knows.
//!
//! Nothing here ever blocks the SDK reader. Appending takes an uncontended
//! lock and a broadcast send that drops the slowest subscriber's view rather
//! than waiting for it, so one slow host cannot stall the protocol.
//!
