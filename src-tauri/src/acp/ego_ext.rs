//! The three methods that are ego's and not ACP's.
//!
//! ACP has no way to hold a turn at a boundary and no way to compact a session
//! into a successor, so ego adds `_ego/pause`, `_ego/resume` and
//! `_ego/compact` under the extension namespace the protocol reserves for
//! exactly this. They are typed here rather than sent as loose JSON because
//! they are a contract with one specific agent at one specific version, and a
//! contract that only exists as a `json!` literal at the call site is one
//! nothing checks.
//!
//! The wire shapes are ego's, read from `AcpHoldRequest`, `AcpHoldResponse`,
//! `AcpCompactRequest` and `AcpCompactResponse` in that repository's
//! `crates/ego-acp/src/serve.rs`. Ego's request structs carry
//! `deny_unknown_fields`, so an extra field here is a rejected call, not a
//! tolerated one.
