//! Pre-built BM25 content index for sub-millisecond file content search.
//!
//! Unlike the grep-then-rerank approach in `fs::search_content_impl`, this
//! module builds a persistent BM25 index over all text files in a repo at
//! load time. Queries hit the in-memory index (~1ms) and then grep only the
//! top-ranked files for exact line matches — avoiding a full repo walk.
//!
//! The index is stored per-repo in `AppState::content_indices` and rebuilt on
//! `RepoChanged` events, but only when a stat-only walk finds an indexable file
//! whose mtime or size moved (`ContentIndex::is_current`) — a git-state change that
//! touches no file content must not pay for a full re-read of the repo. When
//! something did move, only the files that moved are re-read and re-embedded
//! (`plan_disk_changes`/`apply_disk_changes`); the whole-corpus rebuild is the
//! fallback for a change set too large to absorb that way.
//!
//! Total resident size across repos is bounded by `enforce_memory_budget`, which
//! drops the least recently used indices after each build. An evicted index is
//! written to `<data_dir>/content-index/` first and restored on the next
//! `ensure_index`, so the bound costs a stat walk on return rather than a
//! rebuild. A restored snapshot is always validated against disk and brought up
//! to date before it serves anything. `repo_watcher::stop_watching` releases a
//! repo's index when it is no longer in use.
//!
//! Search results need only the BM25 embeddings and their file ids. The source
//! text is deliberately dropped after each build; a future feature that needs
//! snippets or previews must read the current file from disk rather than serve
//! a stale second copy retained by the index.
