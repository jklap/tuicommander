//! Liveness of the desktop WebView's main JS thread.
//!
//! On 2026-09-08 the WebView went white and stayed white for five hours while
//! the backend kept serving HTTP and running 19 PTY sessions. Nothing in the
//! logs said so. The frontend's own freeze detector (`freezeDetector.ts`) runs
//! on a `setInterval` on the very thread it watches, so a block that never ends
//! is the one case it can never report — by construction.
//!
//! `grid frame gate stuck` is NOT that signal either, however much it looks like
//! one. A hidden terminal deliberately never acks its frames (see
//! `CanvasTerminal.onFrame`), so the gate is stuck for every session whose tab
//! is not visible and the warning is routine background noise.
//!
//! So the frontend beats, once every `HEARTBEAT_PERIOD_SECS`, from the main thread —
//! the absence of a beat is the whole signal, which is why it cannot be derived
//! from anything the frontend computes. The diagnostics thread reads it.
//!
//! Desktop only: this watches the embedded WebView. A browser client that stops
//! beating has simply been closed, and a second client would mask the first.
