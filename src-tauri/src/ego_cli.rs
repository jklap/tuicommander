//! Running ego's own command line, for the configuration ACP does not carry.
//!
//! ACP has no provider surface and must not grow one: which model a person
//! defaults to, and whether a provider has a credential at all, are ego's
//! configuration rather than a property of a session. So the Providers tab reads
//! and writes that configuration by running ego exactly as a person would, and
//! TUICommander stores no key of its own and speaks to no provider.
//!
//! Four rules this module exists to keep, each of them a thing that goes wrong
//! quietly when it is left to a caller:
//!
//! * **The binary is the configured one.** No argument names a program, so no
//!   caller over IPC or HTTP can choose what this host launches — the same rule
//!   `acp_commands` keeps for the ACP spawn.
//! * **There is no key parameter.** `ego config set` has a closed key set, and
//!   of it the Providers tab writes exactly one, `model`. Spelling that as a
//!   dedicated operation rather than a generic `set(key, value)` means a caller
//!   cannot reach `sandbox` or `permissions.judge` at all, rather than being
//!   refused by a list somebody has to remember to update.
//! * **A value may not look like a flag.** The arguments never touch a shell, so
//!   there is nothing to quote; what is left is a value starting with `-`, which
//!   clap would read as an option. Refused here, and `--` is passed as well.
//! * **A failure carries what ego printed.** Swallowing stderr turns "no
//!   credential for anthropic" into "something went wrong", which is the one
//!   thing a person looking at a Providers tab cannot act on.
