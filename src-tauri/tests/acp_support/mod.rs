//! Shared setup for the ACP client tests.
//!
//! `tests/fixtures/acp/ego-initialize.json` is a recording of what real ego
//! answers, copied from ego's own committed golden at
//! `crates/ego-cli/tests/goldens/tuicommander/initialize.json`, which that
//! repository generates by spawning the packaged binary. Editing it here to
//! make a test pass would turn the recording into a wish.
//!
//! Every ACP test needs the same three things: a root directory, a scenario
//! inside it for the fixture agent to run, and a manager pointed at that agent.
//! They are here so a scenario name is the only thing a test has to say, and so
//! the root outlives the manager — a `TempDir` dropped early deletes the
//! directory the child is still running in, which fails as a protocol error
//! somewhere far from the cause.
//!
//! Compiled into every ACP test binary, and no binary uses all of it — a
//! protocol test has no turns to wait on, a turn test never builds a session
//! authority by hand. The unused half of this module in any one binary is the
//! price of having one copy of each helper instead of five.
