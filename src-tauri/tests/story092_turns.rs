//! Story092 batch 4: turns, their updates, and how they end.
//!
//! A turn is the one thing on this connection that outlives the call that
//! started it. It takes as long as a model takes, it produces output the whole
//! time, and it can be asked to stop halfway. Everything here follows from
//! that: the caller is handed a turn id rather than an outcome, the outcome and
//! the output travel on the event stream where more than one reader can see
//! them, and the actor stays free to act while the turn is running.
//!
//! Ego owns what the turn actually did. What is proved here is that this client
//! reports it in the order it happened, does not invent an ending, and does not
//! quietly send content the agent said it cannot read.
