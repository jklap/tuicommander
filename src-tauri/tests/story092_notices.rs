//! Story092 batch 6: the wake signal.
//!
//! A host is not always reading the stream. It may be a phone with the app in
//! the background, or a window nobody has opened yet. What it needs then is not
//! the turn — it is being told that there is something worth coming back for,
//! and where.
//!
//! So the notice bus carries four things and nothing else: the connection is
//! usable, something you were waiting on finished, the agent is waiting on a
//! person, that question was answered. Everything a turn actually says stays on
//! the per-connection stream, which is what the rest of this suite proves; what
//! is proved here is that the chunks never reach the shared bus, because a bus
//! every subscriber in the app shares cannot carry one connection's chatter
//! without starving the rest of them.
