//! Story092 batch 5b: the controls that steer a session rather than drive it.
//!
//! `session/set_config_option` is ACP's; `_ego/pause`, `_ego/resume` and
//! `_ego/compact` are ego's, advertised under `agentCapabilities._meta.ego` and
//! present only because ego is on the other end. All four share one property
//! that the tests below are built around: the agent is the authority, and this
//! client's job is to refuse locally exactly what the agent could never honour,
//! then to record what the agent said without softening it.
//!
//! Two answers in particular are not failures and must not be treated as such.
//! A hold that reports `pending` means the request is on record and the turn
//! has not reached a boundary yet — only `paused` says nothing more runs. And a
//! compaction whose publication is uncertain is not a compaction to retry: a
//! second attempt risks a second successor for one source.
