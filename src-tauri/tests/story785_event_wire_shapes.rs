//! Story 785: the JSON an ACP host actually receives.
//!
//! Every other test in this suite matches on the Rust enum, which is the one
//! reader that never sees the wire. A SolidJS store does: it gets a `Channel`
//! frame on the desktop and a WebSocket text frame in the browser, both of them
//! `serde_json` output, and it has to discriminate nine event kinds off one
//! `kind` field. So the shape of that JSON is a contract, and a contract with
//! no test is a guess.
//!
//! It also catches a failure the typed tests structurally cannot: an internally
//! tagged enum refuses at *serialization* time, not at compile time, so a
//! variant that cannot be written is indistinguishable from one nobody has sent
//! yet until something tries.
