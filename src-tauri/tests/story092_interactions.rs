//! Story092 batch 5a: the questions the agent asks back.
//!
//! Everything else on this connection is the client asking and the agent
//! answering. These two methods run the other way, and they are the only place
//! where a *person* is on the critical path: the agent stops, and stays
//! stopped, until someone decides.
//!
//! That is what makes the seat the unit here. The SDK hands the responder to a
//! callback that holds the dispatch loop, so answering there would freeze the
//! connection for as long as the person takes — including the updates that say
//! what they are being asked about. The responder is therefore carried out of
//! the callback and parked, and what is proved below is that it is always
//! answered exactly once: by the person, by the cancel that took the question
//! away from them, or immediately when there was no seat to offer.
