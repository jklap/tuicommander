//! Story092 batch 3: durable session operations across the connection.
//!
//! The connection layer could be proved without ever sending a second request,
//! because everything before this happened inside `initialize`. From here the
//! manager has to reach a live connection *after* `connect` returned, which is
//! the thing the earlier shape could not do at all: the SDK connection lived
//! only inside the supervisor closure and nothing outside could speak on it.
//!
//! Ego owns durable session identity, history, lineage and state. What these
//! tests are about is the client half — that a returned durable id becomes an
//! attachment carrying the authority it was created with, that an operation the
//! agent never advertised is refused before a byte is written, and that a
//! refusal leaves nothing attached.
